 Yeah. I'll just send it to the MRI. You can do whatever you got to do. Sure, it's my. Appreciate it. Thank you. So my old source crashed a little bit ago. So I had to rebuild what we were building yesterday in order to do the aggregate limit. This part was. Is kind of annoying the way that they're asking for it. So I'm just going to walk through how I decided to build it. But this is really just kind of where expertise comes into play when it comes to, you know, funky things that credit unions as for. And just understanding the portfolio loans and taking some creative license. To get in there because there's more than one way to scenicap. But what we were doing is we took the actual output. There's 18,700 and you know, 95. And then we took these are all the individual qualifiers. And what their proposed limits are. And then we had to get information from the originating loan. So we needed information on the category and like the card status unique ID because that information was not carried through. And then Alice is we kept the account number. But we did not keep the unique ID, which is actually the differentiator between the line of credit and a credit card. So just kind of food for thought on that in the future Chris, when you're doing this the clip step two. And you're assigning the values the clip database keeps a field called account number. You may want that to be the true unique identifier at the loan level. Otherwise you're going to do some funky stuff like this that's a pain. All right. So what we're doing here is we've already found our credit union or sorry, we've already found our. Cardholders, we filtered based on the following criteria. We made sure that the limits were assigned as so. And now we're doing this part down here. So we reviewed credit cards and reviewed lines of credit for the institution. What they're now asking is for the individual cards not to have a maximum aggregate above these values. So if just and Todd individual user has a credit card and a line of credit and has a 600. A 600 credit score, then we'll just say 650 because that's the qualifying limit. The on credit score. So say 650 between those two lines of credit. We cannot go above 13,000. So if one card if the credit card was 5,000 and the line of credit was 5,000. And they qualified, then we could only give them up to it $3,000 increase because they're already at 10,000. Does that make sense? Everybody. Yep. Yep. Sorry, we're all muted. And they also want this as another caveat based on the monthly spend. So they have a lot of additional parameters that they're trying to kind of meet here. So I'm going to walk you through kind of what I did. And then we'll finish finish it up because that's not quite finished yet. So basically like I was saying, we need to grab a couple pieces from the originating loan file and join it them to all the qualifiers because this qualifier list is going to have both credit cards lines of credit. On it, there's also some users with multiple credit cards. There's some users with credit card and line of credit. There's some users with multiple lines of credit. And then there's some users with multiple credit cards and multiple lines of credit. So this was fun. This was really fun. This is what I enjoy doing on my weekends. So I think that we can get home. Yeah, no, we're still. It took a lot longer than expected. So we're joining in the records and you know, across the and Chris, this will make more sense to you guys. I know Agnid just try to follow along and I'll explain kind of what's going on as we do it from like a high level. But here we're joining in the attributes between the card holder qualifying file and the legacy source file that we need in. And we have more records joining then we have qualifiers. So what we're doing is we're trying to get the number down to unique level. So we're only getting one actual unique ID at the at the row level. So that's the best we can get having one off. So from there, I create a filter. So the top line filters going for credit cards. The bottom line is going for lines of credit. So it's almost pretty similar split 9,000 to 9,700. And we're just adding another rank system for them. So. Oh, what we're doing here is we're taking the values and we're ranking them. So as you see, we have two account numbers that are the exact same. We have the individual, it's exact same. If you scroll all the way over, they have both a credit card and a line of coverage. But the way that we we decided and by we I mean Chris and John and I agree. They want to rank credit card above the line of credit. And for the increase. So if the members at the aggregate limit already, then we won't do anything. But if they are not, then we increase the credit card over the line of credit. Everybody follow him. So I rank them. So the credit card when there's multiple source key numbers that align with different rows. They will always rank as a credit card above the line of credit. Okay. So what about the people who only have a line of credit? Are they just ranked two? Correct. Okay. Yeah. So like this one right here. Just to line of credit, rank two. So come back here. Just Beverly by herself. Little bit of doing her thing. Uh-huh. So she's just a line of credit. So she's just a two. So the idea here, Chris, is that every single one of these, we proposed an increase to. So what we're doing is we're going back against that and we're going to filter them. So we only increase the ones that we want to increase in those being credit cards in this particular moment. If there are multiple lines of credit, if so in this case like Beverly is going to come through and. She has a. 6500 credit limit and she's not using any of it right now. So we proposed to bring her from 6500 up to 10,000 and her. Um, peak spend is only 1393. So it's not really anywhere close. Um, but we can see that her average credit line on her open trade lines is 13,000 1,33. So it makes sense to at least bring her from 6500 up to 10. And that will be closer. Uh, if the negative limit is what she's seeking to get it more. or hopefully bring that back to top of wallet. So, you know, and this is the problem with lines of credit is obviously, it's not necessarily a way of putting that in top of wallet. Oh yeah, this was a line of credit, sorry. Yes, that is correct. Oh, that is correct. Oh. Okay. So we're going to present them everything. So everything's going to have a proposed new limit. Everything, not necessarily. Okay. So what we did after the ranking, we wanted to find the ones because they are explicit about these and they just gave us their entire portfolio. So after searching, it appears that they already break these values internally. So we're not going to offer lines of credit increases or suggestion lines of increases on these. So their numbers going to go from the 18,000, almost 19,000 records down to like 2,000 records. And they started with 33,000. So out of their entire portfolio, they gave us between lines of credit. We're only going to suggest an increase on about 2,000 lines of credit because they break these parameters. And they go higher than what they're saying should be the max aggregate limit. So we analyzed all the cards. So we're still charging them on 24, 25,000, but our suggested increase is going to be significantly lower. Then what we would normally send to client. Any questions? We can always explain that. Like your parameters limited us dramatically. Yeah, yeah, for real. So so here we are. So basically what I did is I wanted to look at the values. So I wanted to make it back at a single row level. I wanted to sum the proposed limits. I wanted to sum the existing credit limit. And then I wanted to take the credit score that we're at. So this will help us determine if we're staying within the range. And the same with the credit cards. And we could look at it at a loan or a row level. Not a loan, not a row. Remember, remember, little. There we go. That's better at a member level. And we added the aggregate bank card over the last 12 months. And we added, I can catnated both the IDs and the categories. So we know that a credit card and line of coverage. We know that these are just lines of coverage. So these were pretty easy. So just looking at them, all of these people qualified. So just by qualifying in general, they aren't breaking any of the aggregate limits. Because these individuals only have lines of credit. They don't have. And then the same thing for like credit cards. There's individuals that only have a credit card. So they're going to get removed from the data set right away. And because they're well within the range of the credit card. So they're good to go. So from there, we broke them out into categories of those that had a comma. So this is the ones that have multiple lines. So they either have the two lines, or you can see there's credit card, line of coverage line of coverage, line of coverage, credit card line of coverage, you know, credit card line line. So we wanted to look at all of these and see if we're breaking the limits here as well. So I take back what I said originally. So these 10,000 are going to get increases right off the bat because these are all just single lines of credit. Or single credit cards. Just get some water. So, so we're actually going to do about 10, 11, 12. So about 12,000 over the 18, there's going to be four, five, six, seven, about 7,000 that are breaking the limit. So they won't get it. So like I said, the first thing we did is we want to break out all the ones that had the multiple lines of credit. Because those are the only ones that we need to look at the aggregate spend. So these 10,000, 399, we can say right away that they're good to go. We don't have any questions about them. They're within the proposed limits because they just qualified in general. And they only have one line of coverage or credit card. So they automatically qualify. They're good. So there's 10, there's 10,000 here that we're recommending. Yeah, to start. There's 10,000. Yep. There's going to be more, too. But yeah, there's 10,000, 399 immediately off the bat. That qualifier that don't have multiple lines of credit. So we don't have to worry about aggregated limit. So after we did that, I created a formula that is basically doing this. So we're saying that if the credit limit is above 775, which is this top tier and the credit scores both to 75. And the credit limit, the existing credit limit is above 25,000, which is the original that we want to give it a one. And we did the same thing for the other buckets. So basically if their current aggregate limit is at the maximum already, we want to filter them out. So what we did here is filter equals one. The filter equals one for all these guys. So these 4,400 are already at the limit. So we're taking them out. So we're going to remove these 4,400 from the qualifier list. Wait a minute, go back to which card to your formula. Well, aren't you... Aren't you giving a lot of people ones that... I'm just thinking about this. So you're saying if the current credit score is greater than 775 and the sum of the credit limit is greater than 25,000, than they don't qualify. But then you're saying if anybody's above 725 and above 18,000 and they don't qualify. What about the people that are 775 and above 18,000? Because now you're just qualifying them. 775, it's greater than 775. So 775 is the bucket to 18,000. I understand that. So the second tier would be 726 to 775 and 8,000. The top... like for example here, you've got scores. Let's say you have a 776. And you have a limit of 26,000. You've got a 1, right? Yes. Okay. Let's say you're a 776 and you have a $15,000 limit. You're going to get a 1,2 in this formula. Because they're above 0 and they're above 13. So you've removed a ton of people that probably qualify. You're going to get a 1,2 in this formula. Um... Okay, Thanksensina All right. So how should we adjust this? So if you go to your formula, you would have to say if current credit score is less than whatever the bottom of that bucket is and greater than the top of the bucket. It seems like you got to fit them into the bucket. Specifically. So you could either create the buckets, like basically if your score is between this and this, you're in bucket 1, bucket 2, bucket 3, and then you could say if you're in bucket 1 and you're greater than 2500 than 1, if you're in bucket 2 and you're greater than 1800 than 1, right? Like there's multiple ways you could do this, but you have to, they have to be in a bucket. I don't have the buckets in front of me, but what was it? 775 to 775, is that right? That's the middle bucket. So 776 to 850. So it's greater than 775. I think the first one can work. It's the second two that you got about, you have to be the bounded. So like people above those scores with lower limits aren't in there. If score is above 725, 726, and less than 775. And less than 776. Yeah. And the sum is 18,000. Then we also want to exclude it. Yeah, else if credit union is greater than zero. So I think that's the only one. And less than 775. So it'll be the last ones. Yep. So let's do it in 26. Yeah. I got run it again. I'll see you. These numbers change to you. So 500. So we can't sort of. So now we're only disqualifying 1100. 1180. Yeah. That's better. Right? Yeah. So we have 1180 and then. So now we did the buckets, but we'll have to just do it the same way, but adjust it. Or. Post. Now limit. So the first one was removing the people that are already at the max aggregate limit for their lines. So even though we said that they needed increases, we were looking at the individual level. Not not the aggregated. So we're going to walk those back. So here we need to. Can we also like put a formula? Oh, is that what you're doing now? To put a formula in selling why they de-kewed. I can put them on there for that. I was going to make the proposed limit the same as. And I guess that makes more sense because their credit unions will come back and ask something silly like that. So these probably won't deny at that point. So 3584 3587. So these are going off the numbers here. So the proposed limit is greater than. So these guys. Their proposed limit is greater than what it should be at. That's not true, but this one is. So that's at 25. So that'll go away. But these two. So a 7701 would be 18,000. So we'll have to create a formula for that. So these DQs. 1327 coming down. So we'll have to adjust these guys. Well, that's not a DQ reason. Then is it. No. It's called a reason. I don't know. Maybe you want to call it decision. I don't know. I obviously those those guys were still passing them, but we adjusted them, right? I mean, I mean, I just adjusted to pass something like that. I mean, you're adjusted max aggregate level down and makes sense. So here. These are the proposed limits. So you can probably go to the same level. This is greater than. Let's see. Here's the issue is the aggregate limit is higher. So we can't do this. On this level. So we're not to figure out how to. If I can create this. You probably rip the formula from before your filter. So I have max aggregate limit. So we don't want to propose them. Yeah, I would put like in the description of that decision. Just put like DQ at max at age limit. Like DQ above max aggregate limit or something like that. And for the ones that we are going to. You're going to have to like grab the formula that you use before your aggregate filter. And just use that because you're going to create your buckets again, right? At this time. Like if you if you say like a one or two and a three and they can say like if this equals. Well, I guess it'll always be a one. When we're all going to equal one. Because they're already filtered to that. So the proposed new limit would just be. But here's the issue. We got the credit cards. And the lines of credit credit card line of credit. So we're taking those first. It's got the credit card first. So we only need to adjust the top. So it needs to be like a multi line tool. It can't just be in here. So I'm just. So this guy's got to. A credit card in a line of credit right. And I suppose new limit on the credit card is 17.5. 7 to 10. So we can walk that back. Yeah, what we need to do is for anybody that's got two lines. We need to basically subtract the line of credit out of. The aggregate right. Yeah, and give it to the other line right. So like you could probably do that. When there's still, when there were still concatenated together. But you can't because you don't know what the values are. You don't know which is which. If you've got one that has a credit card and an LC, we know we're going to promote the credit card right. Correct, but we don't have both limits. So we'd have to concatenate both credit limits in order to do that. Okay. So because we don't know what what the limit is. So that's why I was thinking like a multi multi row formula tool. To do it. But it's going to be crazy because it's not always going to be two lines. Sometimes there's three lines. So. This is where it gets hairy. Okay. So we're still working on these. These guys. This one was done proposed to limit zero because they're already above the limit. So these guys now we have to adjust it but not here. So we have the decision just in the box. And we got to see how this works. Well, you could pull off a. You could transform come off of there. It like a total. Right. And then. Append it back in. So then you would have the total line. And it's every row. Does that make sense? Do you know what I mean? And I'm making sense. Like if you if you came off of there and then some. Something everything based on account number. Then you could like you could like append back like the total aggregate to every line. That would just do it down there. That's only 2000 records. I want to put all of them. Okay. Here we heard it. Have them broken out. So it's not that unique. Do they count number level? Because that will be unique now. Wait. Are they all there? They're concatenated there already. Yeah. Do you have the sum of the. Crag it. That's the sum that's aggregate right. Yeah. Okay. Ashtay. What I said, you have too many tools on the canvas and the value like what. Just this particular clip more complicated than any others that you have run before. So that's the process. I mean, this is very much the process that you go through. And now this is this is additional steps, but very aggravating additional steps. Yeah, I think this entire part of it is pretty much. And ad hoc requests for extra consideration of parameters. Like this entire workflow that we're looking at here is something we wouldn't normally do. Correct. So 718. This individual is 718. So they're going to get 13,000 max. So they're already at 13 proposed on that. So we need to back out that guy the 1500. Because our current credit limit is here. So when you take in the credit limit in the proposed. Well, what you can do, you take the sum of the credit limit and subtract off. So you take the aggravated max, subtract off the sum of the current credit limit. That gives you the maximum amount you can apply. Right. So 115. So we have something there that tells you what the max is right. Right. Let me. Some credit limit. Well, I got an ice credit limit. Wait. I'm confused. So what do we have? Yeah, you're going to need that. All right. So we want to take the proposed limit minus the credit limit. We need to know what the, you need to know what the max available is for the line. Why did this change? Why would it? So you, you need to take, you need to take the maximum. That's allowed for their bucket. Do we have that in here? Something's telling us it's over the, the total amount. So do we have, that's not in here. Does it, because it's, it's only in a formula above the kind of breaks it down. Like, what we're going to need to do is have a formula that says, like, if your credit score is between here and here, then max this, if your credit score is between here and here, then max that. And then once you can have the max per row, you can take the maximum minus their current credit limit. And then the C. What's the maximum, you can do to take it to that max bucket. Makes sense? No. So hold on 13. 13 is the max for this guy in this case. That's the max, that's the max proposed. That's the max that he can get proposed. Yeah. So we want to walk out his other bucket. So the proposed, the sum of the proposed, because they're both getting it. So we don't want to do that. We want to do the proposed new credit limit. Well, hang on a second. Wouldn't we only pick the top one anyway in this scenario? And give the money to the top one. Well, you can't, you can't give him 14. Five. Can you? You can, you can inflate above the 13. But that's what I'm saying. Like he gets 13, which is the max for the credit card. So we don't want to give the 1500 on the second line. So I think that for anybody that's in this bucket that has an LC and a, if they have credit card in an LC, just go ahead and back out the LC's all together. Right? Let's see, that's just an LC right there. Right. So essentially, 826, Kraylin at 5000. Oh, there's two of them. There's two LC's. No. Hold on. Why did that credit card not? Right. Good. Good. Good. The rest of the order. Dear bro. Um. Can you join back in the, um. The concatenated products. So you know. Then you could say like if category contains a comma. And all of them can tannic on them. No, no. Every single one of them can tannic on them. Oh, you have them there, right? Yeah. So if you could say some of them have two commas. Right. But the data beyond that loses that concatenated category doesn't it? Yeah, I can add this. So every single one of them in here has a credit card. And line a coverage or credit card and two lines of coverage. Okay. Or here. This one has two lines of coverage. Okay. I think what you need to do is filter it out. So if concatenated category has CC. We're going to go one way and if it does not have CC, that means it's multiple lines of coverage. So I think you're going to have some different way ways of filtering this stuff right because. One, if they've got a credit card and line a coverage, we're going with credit card. If they've got two lines of coverage, now we got to go look at which one we want to adjust. So if the concatenated category has CC in it, we'll go true. So if contains concatenated category CC or contains concatenated category CC. So if contains concatenated category CC, concatenated category CC. So all those ones that are going to go true. You guys are too a clock already. So we're going to have to rejoin again. Reoclock. So all the credit card ones we would promote the credit card. And just take all the ones that are LC and take them to zero. Right. And what are the other scenarios there that they have multiple credit cards? Now here they're not that they have multiple. Are there any words like CCCC? No. Okay. So yeah, so everybody that is an LC in this bucket, the LC, would have a decision that adjusted down due to multiple products. Or just a zero. Just de-cute for multiple product or something like that. But just the LC ones. Okay. If your decision would be if category equals LC, then proposed line zero. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Because the proposed new limit on the credit card is the maximum, no matter what. It's not like you can shift the money from one to the other right. I don't know. That's what I was going to. That's what I was about to say because here they're saying a max aggregate. But here they've already bucketed the maximum as these. So we're not taking that additional money and just lump it on to the credit card. So that's what I would say. Yeah. Like look, you gave these parameters. No matter what. We're not taking if you had a line of code. Yeah. So if we have a line of credit that we're not taking from the line of credit to apply that additional $2,000 to the maximum. Okay. Of the credit card. Okay. Yeah. We can. No, no, no, no, no, I don't think we should. I think that's it. I think that's it. So if they have a line of credit. We're promoting the credit card over the line of credit. So we're bad. Anybody that's got a credit card in a line of credit. We've. They can then other stuff out. I think we need to jump to this other meeting. Okay. I'll jump on over there and let them know that you guys are coming. Okay. Thank you. No wrong. So decisions categories on credit. Then. So it's already saying adjusted max aggregate limit down. So that's not correct. Right. We have to change the decision. The category equals LC. Then. Then. Then. Adjust say. No, say say. D. D. Cude. Or. Like this. Disqualified line or something like that. D. D. D. Cude. DQ DQ DQ DQ D line. To promote. DQ line of credit. No. I don't want to say this. How about DQ multiple. Product or something like that. That's fine. DQ line of credit for credit card. That's fine. It's explainable. Let me overthink this. So then. But that means the other credit cards are going to say adjusted max aggregate limit down, which isn't the case. No, I could just I think we need to change that decision to say something like. So if categories, then TQ line. L. Discussion. Look. What we. What do we got safer approved. Like a. Recommended increase or something like that. Recommended increase or like, what do we say, and for the ones that were. We don't say anything because the file is recommended increases. So if line of credit, then DQ line of credit for credit card. I'm not going to be these guys wait on a hop over to this other call. It's already been seven minutes. Okay. I'm calm. All right, Agni. We'll probably meet after this if you're still interested. Yeah. We have three. Okay. Yeah. I have a three o'clock, but I'll join you if I can. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thanks for recording. Thank you. Bye. That's recording.
