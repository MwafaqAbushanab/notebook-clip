 Grab that beer on the way back. Don't let me. We come back you to say, I'll lay out to these calls, or forever, Agna. Do you want you done? I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. So, yeah, I don't know, I have a couple nice weeks all. We'll enjoy just being whatever outside of work. I'm just being whatever outside of work. What's going to be a show weekend, so we'll start there. We'll start there. Got a baseball game tomorrow, and have a bunch of little kiddos trick or treat him tonight. I don't know. I don't typically give candy away or anything, but sometimes we'll go to the neighbor, so she's just hanging out with him, whatever. There you go. If I will or not tonight, I just kind of feel like we got home and I do my own thing. Hey, there's nothing wrong with that. Oh, no. There's a number of some Halloween evenings that have to really warm just because running round all sweaty and today is not going to be like that. Yeah, yeah, it's going to be nice and chilly. I am back. Guess I was back again. Not Christopher. Okay. Are you sharing anything? No. No. I'll wait. Okay. All right, champ. So we decided that the first time we were going to be here, the first bucket where all straight proposals, because these are all one credit card or one line of coverage. But that is, that is the decision we're saying is proposed line. So these are the ones that I have straight proposed limits. So yeah, I just to propose line in, because this is what we're using over here. So we're saying that if it was a line of coverage, that would be just a small slide. But the credit cards are getting proposed line. Because these are all the ones that have multiple lines. And these are the ones that are just straight yessies. So we're good there. And then these are the ones that with the DQ was above the max aggregate limit. Okay. the false off of those non credit card ones down below right yeah so here we have the 25 49 which is the last last of the moheakens that were looking at and there's like 22 of that false at the bottom oh so for these we got to figure out which is our double lines mm-hmm they look like identical to like yeah some of them have a balance some of them don't they're very very similar 45 49 I don't know I mean we can take it as a day so for for these don't we just want to we want to just take one of whatever their lines are right yeah okay let's see we have we have two here and we're saying that they both get an increase so coming from 45 49 100 so a 35 so we do this why don't we sort them by their highest current limit to sort them by account number and highest credit limit uh this makes sense and then just increase the the higher line yeah so I mean that's what I was thinking but like there's there's just weird cases where you know they have balances on both one of them has a high balance one of them doesn't have a high balance so this one's proposed to go to 10 they have a current balance of five on the six where they have a balance of 276 on 42 100 so and it's both for the same person I mean do we want to these ones they both have all of this ones almost maxed out yeah like I don't this is gonna be a question for the credit union right yeah I mean we can bucket them as like here here's yeah here's like a review 22 we don't know how you want to handle it and we didn't go this in depth but um they all have lines of coverage and we don't want to increase them what we're seeing here is that all of these would qualify as a standalone on a you know case by case basis but they have multiple lines and in case of this one they're both almost maxed out at what the line of coverage is but the attributes credit credit credit credit credit credit credit can't ever take me out of it and but everything else looks good otherwise so you know and this average is significantly higher he has a lot of money he rotates on the bun on them so yeah these are weird I mean on one hand I'm like hey here's more money to rotate around on here I'll earn interest off of you on the other hand I'm like you look like your risky is how yeah but I mean that's that's that's the case though curse like we that's that's why we get such good returns especially when it comes to the you know interchange and interesting come because we we look at lines and if they have a 6,000 dollar limit we find the right borrowers even make be rotating 5,500 but it could also just be like a snapshot time you know what I mean like you can carry like a hundred dollar balance for 11 months but this one month he had to max out his his line because I don't know something at home happened so it's always it's always one of those kind of snapshots but I mean everything else in the line looks looks good so I say Sally can get it. Carp one yeah I guess what we could do here is just have these come off as like you for do put it lines of credit or review as decision I don't know I mean all of this stuff needs to be reviewed the question is how do we want to put these decision comments okay then the day they're not going to get upset the 22 loans we said you make the decision and then and we could even take a step further and be like what did you review additionally what would you like us to do in the future for this and we'll we'll just take care of it so but we wanted to get you the data before the deadline so okay so there's that one that's gonna be yep so into the union what's the last bucket it was the ones off of the proposed that are not hitting their limits so they have an aggregate limit and they're going to 9000 and they are not hitting their limits so let's just do the scosore descending see yeah so they're all maxing at 25 their current is 20 they're going to 25 but these are all 800 scores so we're okay so they're not hitting their limits as in these basically all qualify yeah these are aggregates like the double to a more line set or have aggregate but the aggregate limit of all the proposed lines is still below the 25000 okay so these then we would still say credit cards there ago line of credits or for going for credit card so 24 794 so 7776 so yeah looks like they're all they're all good to go okay so same thing here we're gonna break them out to there are all 800's and 700's high 7's and all of their in both lines are in here and yeah these are all credit cards aligned and then there's one here that's three lines okay so these are going to be broken back out again into individual rows or correct yeah okay yeah but look so he's at 850 credit score he's got three different lines and we can come over here and just look real quick and we can look at all three lines proposed still below 25 I just want to make sure all three those all three of those lines are in that bucket right and we didn't decision any of these other loans anywhere else to me they're all in here right no these are all in here okay well a lot of them only have a single unique ID they have three oh are they all broken out so they all all there okay yeah just the 24 is the max limit but these are the three different lines seeing they're all the same account number but these are the three unique IDs so it's a credit card line of coverage line of coverage a couple of your copy and doubt yes so for these we want to say if concatenated category as CC all right they all have CC uh every single I mean I don't know so there's CC and CC so we're adjusting both and then there's CC CC LC so we could see like what they are but yeah it looks like every single one of them has at least nope looks like we have a lot more of these LC LCs down here yeah we're just fine just all of them have credit cards and then here they stop and they get lines of coverage lines of coverage but even on both lines of coverage they're both under the threshold for the credit score they have so we're just saying to approve multiple lines of credit with increases they never said that they didn't want yeah they did they said they only want one line chosen the only one line chosen that's my that was my interpretation of everything which is why there's the 22 below are down there for review for which one so the other ones were credit cards so here we would have to do the same thing so here you're saying to blanket the credit cards and disinvalde the others well here's the thing we're going to have to because there's some that multiple credit cards right so we're going to have the decision those where it's just CC comma LC we can break them out basically say we're picking the credit card over the line of credit and then for we're going to have to come up with other scenarios I think basically any of them where they have a CC right where making that same decision that the LC row is going to be what's with the blank until I get in bro hey I want to join that last meeting your mart and mothwock asked me to like add them to all meetings we do so I guess I'll just forward them then right to this one so give you a heads up thank you yeah don't run so these we have to review too okay I didn't will you ever complicated now CC LC CC LC And LCLC, we have to figure out. Right, but those that are CCLC and CCLC, all the LCs we are going to disqualify in favor of the CC. Correct? Yeah. Okay. So for this filter, you can have a decision. Okay. So I'm going to... I'll try to figure out what to do. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to... I'll try to figure out what to do. Okay. Okay. Metadata. So... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'll try to figure it out. I'll try to figure it out. So that's good. But yeah. So here. So all if category... Do not have LCLC. Well, that was category. Oh, it into the... Oh, yeah. I'm going to do that first. Of course. You got to break out the categories. This is mind-bending. Yeah, that first beer is going to be great tonight. I'll tell you that. Yeah. So I said this is so annoying. Okay. Alright. So now that we have these back, we're ranking them... If category is... LCLC... And zero. Okay. Proposed line. LCLC. Sato. So that worked. Beautiful. Okay. So now we're going to come off that false. So yeah. Now we've got this big beauty. So these are just LCLC's. LCLC's again. So we should buff it. So we should buff it. Yeah. CCC isn't here too. Oh yeah. But I'm saying we should take the LCLC's and bucket them down here. Yeah, you're right. With these because it's the same damn thing. Yep. So we actually have more. Yeah, if there's like 240 of them in need review. Yeah. But it's just the LCLC's right. Where do you want to send the CCC's down there too? I hold on. I just put 10 there wrong place. Yeah. Well that's right. So we're taking. Yeah. So we're taking out the proposed limit. I don't think I meant to do that. No. So we're still leaving the limits for them. Down there we are. Yeah. Why did I even, we don't need this? What's well. So here we need to remove. And we need to do two filters off that. So we're going to do a filter and a filter. But this is the filter to the filter. Why are you, why are you having another filter come off of there? It's the wrong location. No. To. Just make sure you're paying attention. The trace bus the bus the filter. Okay. So let me to this 283. So the CC's. So these we just want to disembow the LCs but we'll. We'll do that second. So we need. LC. I don't know. There more. So now I just the LCLC is we need to move. So. Oh, I'll see. If we can get category of LCLC. We can get category equals LCLC. And we get the trace bus the bus the. Yeah, you can go through sort of that union down there. Yeah, but I can't go right into the union. Oh, it's got to go through the thingy. It's got to go through the thingy. And you. So why did I add this? Why did we add what the union there? Or the filter. So I end up filter. The cathilp the fish. Can you. I'm so confused. Yeah, it's pretty cool. What happened was. It's too ridiculous. I. It was. Two, seventy. Sexy. I don't know where they're. Oh, two, eighty. See, on the majority of these are LCLCs. So we're going to go. We got to go back to the LCLC land, you know. P. Now, I'll go filter. Now I'll go filter. So these are going to go here because these are the same things. These are all. LCLCs union at before the. Oh, we the reason we had that sort there was to like promote the. Right. Yeah, we were just looking at the lines. We don't want to end up doing anything with it. Yeah, because there. So I'm just going to bring it over here. But it's the same thing. Well, here we are with the dang zeros again. Well, I, I, I turned it off so we're not doing this. That's fine. All right. So the data's coming through. No records. I know John. Can't connect on a con cat. You're, you connected on the con cat. Um. You need to go to. And cat. In the. Not just on my wills. What's the unique idea those guys? Yeah. It seems like there's like. What the world. So it only exists where where's the other stuff coming from. Like going from here. Same pipeline. Yeah. That's where you're. 3500. 4000. I'm just going up there unique idea somewhere. No. Oh, look at me. I'm here. Oh, look at me. I'm here too. Okay. They all, we go down. They're all sitting there on the right. There's nothing there. There's nothing from anywhere. There's nothing from anywhere. There's nothing there. There's nothing from anywhere. Do we do that process? We didn't run it. I need to go home. That's like that. Check. Oh, my. Yeah. Good. Yeah. I need to go home. I'm 76, 86, 96. We all just sit there. Won't you speak up? Jesus. Yeah. I'm really proud. Well, I was thinking that you're just validating it from the code and everything as well. All right. Yeah. This is just ridiculous. Normally you don't have to do this. This is just so kinds or ridiculous. But now we're here to. We're down to seven loans, guys. Seven loans. Can you do this? I'll be like, no. No. No. Can I? This is way more in depth than what we normally do for a clip. Oh, God. So I'm never going to remember what's what. Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. So there's other lines of credit down there. Yeah. So there's going to be two lines of. Well, one line of credit. One line of credit. So it's just this guy. So we can just slap. We can just slap. See. Yes. So if category is Lc. And DQ. Four credit card. And then. Well, we're going to do these credit cards. They look identical. It's weird. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. So. Well, so. limit, so just sort them by the limits. Take it to the limit. I mean, like also, if we had more information, it might help us, like, you know, and I can tell all of this is like, I don't know if you've got a rewards card that you might wanna increase the limit over the non-reward card, right? Like, anything to try and get people to use cards more. Yeah. Usually rewards card has been used more, right? Yeah, yeah. Because once the increase recently happened to me also, like the increase in the annual fee, initially they said, no fee, then they started. After so many years they started. Oh, you're using it, so we'll increase it. And pay some fee for that for extra credits or extra rewards. And then you can just add that to the card. That's one has three. Oh, but this is the line of coverage though. No, this is the line of coverage. It's line of credit. Yes, that's what I said. Line of credit. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right, so... Well, we're gonna have to do it centrally. So we want to take the credit and we're going to zero it. And then just take the first value. So it's gonna be you. You. And do we want to say multiple credit cards or review? Because there's only like three accounts here to me reviewing. All right, so just take out of our hands. So take the LC make it a zero because that follows the other logic. DQ line of credit for credit card L. Credit card for multiple credit card for review or something like that. Do duplicate credit card for review? Okay. Do duplicate. Do duplicate. Arriba. All right, so that she was a total. With everybody decision right. What do you like to know? 18, 796, 18, 796. There she believes. Beautiful. Give me this thing. Now, I'm gonna just send an nickname. Filter right. Who am I? She's always who's getting all these dang fields. Okay. Okay. Are these fields coming from? What? Left and right, so they're gonna have to be coming from unions. So go look at your joint. Just did. Aggregate spend over 12 months. So we'll give them the category. The unique idea. Decision. And remove the other stuff. So that should be everything. Because here we have 31, 27, so it's you. It's you. You know what happens to it in there. So everything looks okay. TTS. It's the critical month decision. Decision. Decision now. So we have five values proposed line. Decude line accredited for credit card. Decude above max aggregate. Dependent line coverage. And Decude line up. Dependent credit card for review. Decude. But max. And then. Dependent. I'll see for review. You click it. C.C. Or review. All right. Those are the five. Decude line accredited. That'll just change to. Share members. Five. Four. Craven. Yeah. Or a winner. If just can. Come. Yeah. Pride. Our next one is. Or. Jahahaha. And just. Okay. There we go again. Again make one small change you got to make it forever time What did you change? Change it from DQD to DQ line of credit. Oh To make it consistent so now yeah credit so we have duplicate credit card for review duplicate line of credit for review 298 there's a lot of those DQ above max aggregate In the case of credit that we do not recommend And increase on in favor of in Resign credit card Scallacks in increase of e Team? Yeah... I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. Oh. Oh, those. That's all it do. I'm just putting it right here. zurück I get to the limit. Buenos Aires 1-0 B pistol I llame All right, so we have the full 14. I'm going to go to this. So I want to go. So all these guys in Sarah, DQ to buff max aggregate limit. So that's pretty cool. Be lacku-licked it. So that's the 0's here. So at this point, right, we would have him review the output and tell us, which if there's anything that they have a different opinion on or what? No, I wouldn't ask for that. I mean, we can have them share the logic for these, but we didn't get enough information. I mean, if you want to go back and they say, oh, yeah, we would take the one with the higher limit, we would take the older line of credit or whatever, then we can implement that into the workflow. And then what I would do is just, I would write a little note down here, you know, just add a little comment box that says something along those lines. Well, I think at this point, like I mean, we just decision everything we could based off of the information they gave us. The only thing that I would want information back on is like what they actually increased lines on, right, because when we're doing analysis next time for them, like full loan grading, we want to be able to give them as much information out, you know, insights on the performance of these line increases that we can. Right, yeah. Yep, so that makes sense and we have the file here, so I can link it to you and you can give it a send. So it is the file that's the qualifying file, don't send them the one that says to you on it. By the way, the qualifying one. Okay. Yeah. So that is there. This is here and that's the show folks. So this one was more of a pain, the reason for that and why we had to create all of this is because the credit union gave us some additional information. And basically, they wanted us to take into account normally our normal process, which is, you know, almost fully automated is doing a sign parameters like this, which are really easy to fix or change. And the signing parameters like this, that again, are very simple to adjust and change. It takes a little bit of manual work, but they wanted to do something slightly different. So instead of saying, hey, anyone that meets this criteria up here gets an increase and that means if Justin has two credit cards and he meets the criteria here. And then he could technically get an increase on both of those credit cards. They wanted us to review their lines of credit and they wanted us to review their credit cards and that we ran into situations where not only do they have a credit card. They may have two credit cards and then a line of credit or multiple lines of credit and a credit card or just multiple lines of credit. There's a lot of different scenarios and when they assign a max aggregate limit across all of their lines of coverage at a member level. Then it gets a little more complicated, but then to further complicate that. They also introduced credit tiers. So now there's a max aggregate limit of just not a flat 25 for anybody that qualified. Now it's broken out by credit tier. So that's another level. And then is if that's not enough, they wanted to break it out by the monthly spend to look at the monthly aggregate spend that we're at least meeting the minimum on on that. So it became a bigger project than originally anticipated. So normally in analysis like this would probably take start to finish maybe three or four hours. I would say it's probably taking about eight hours now. We today are really going to look for like in the manga. Say what? No, which data in the work flow will do that analysis is it your depth? Where do we get the information? The data which you said eight hours right. So it has two process the data. Yeah, so they sent us a data file. Oh, we. Yeah, so this was the data file that they sent us and we reviewed it and we ran it through our workflows got it cleansed for trans union got it back from trans union and then re viewed the information. And then we had to get in our database. We had we had to append some additional fields that we're missing. So we had to add them. And then we had to do a bunch of scrubbing and ranking and a bunch of different work as well on everything before we can create an output and then we have different decisions that we came up with at the very end of the day. And then we just gave them this file. So the 18,796 records were all those that qualified for a line increase based on our normal clip process. But because they introduced new parameters like this. We had to kind of work on the fly and adjust those and then doing so. 13,843 records still received proposed line increases as is. 3400 we disqualified the line of credit for credit card. So this means that the member had both a credit card and a line of credit and the institution said that they wanted to give. I'm sorry, they left it up to us to determine. So we made the decision to give the credit line increase to the credit card not to the line of credit. And then these loans about 1100 of them words is qualified because they're above the max aggregate limit. So we're seeing the 13,834 lines. We are saying increase those increase. Yes. Yeah. I didn't realize the volume was that high. Yeah, we would have increased 18,000 plus loans based on we started with 33,000. Keep that in mind. Got you. Got you. So yeah, we're still saying 13,000 should get increased. Whether it's a credit card or a line of credit. And then there's some duplicates that we did not clarify with them beforehand. So these six duplicates for review or credit cards. And by duplicate, it's not it's not really a duplicate. It's like Justin Todd has two credit cards. One has a $5,000 limit. The other one has a $6,000 limit. But based on the attributes, both of them qualify for a proposed limit increase. We didn't get information from the credit union on how to determine which of those two lines should receive the increase. So whether they go off the oldest card, whether they go off the highest balance, the highest credit limit. We didn't clarify that information. So I'm fine, given it back to them. If they wanted to, these lines still qualify for these are all lines that we say qualify anyways. So it's fine just to give them the increase on all of them. But we added a decision field that we never do when we do this type of analysis and we're sending it out to them. We will say, kind of what happens there. And final decision for those 13.000 is solely by the credit union right, whether they want to increase or not. Those 13.000, the first line proposed or line increase. They will take the decision to increase or not. So it's always their decision. So we give them this field proposed limit increase. And we always allow them to choose. This is just what we suggest that they increase to. But they can adjust it as they see fit because they're their members and they may know Donna better than we do. We're looking at the data, which gives a pretty holistic view, but they may know their individual members better and maybe they decide that they don't want to give a $19,000. Okay. Limit. Yes. Okay. So I don't like this. Well, it's been delivered to Nick. So. But to me, you don't like it. I don't like this. This is above the max limit right here for. That's two people. Sorry. Look, it's the same person. Nancy Hughes, it's above the max limit. There's one credit card and two lines of coverage. And we de-cute all of them for being above the max aggregate limit. But if you take out the credit card. We could have given the increase to the credit card. It doesn't matter. They don't want them to have above the max aggregate of the amount. All right. Oh, their current is above the max aggregate amount. Yeah. Okay. We're good. I got stopped looking at this. I'm going to find all kinds of stuff. All right. So that's fine. They're joined. We're Gucci. And that's it. Any other questions, guys? No, just a thanks film. Thank you. I don't know. I don't know. I'm thinking of any AP. I don't know if we need to schedule anything for that. Looks reasonable. Yeah. I mean, we're not going through the. We don't have one. Yeah. We don't have one to to go through. But. Yeah. Yeah. We can we can run through the high level process. And I can you know, pretend that we're going through it. But we're not going to be able to get as in depth on something like this with it. So. But yeah. Yeah. We can we can do something along this lens. We've been working on a two-pound schedule. So. A lot of Sweden. They have as lookingspring dogs. Hi. Playing it for the next week. Hi. Everybody to take these pictures.
