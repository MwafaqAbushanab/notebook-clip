 I got you. I can do you. You're good. Righty. I got you. I got you. You guys in the room. Is it. I got you. Or. I got you. Oh. All right. There you go. Oh. First you want to go to the. Is it agneth or is it agneth? Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Agneth. Yeah. Let's go. Agneth. This is. Susha. Like a sound like Susha. Oh. Yeah. Susha. Yeah. They want to. Did you speak any training or a restaurant? I understand very well. I don't. I'm terrible. I'm speaking. I can't. But not very good. I can't. I can't. I want to. How about German? Oh, no. That's. I'm just. Yeah. Thank you problem. Yeah. Okay. I don't like the German that was nothing. It is the German people. I just don't. Yeah. Are you. Do you think you're not going to stay there? Or much longer? Well, you stayed there longer? I hope not. That's not my dream country if you ask him. No. Neither is no. Okay. Just there. A little that I've seen. I can't do shots of vodka. vodka. Go to Russia. Go to Russia. Go to Bosnia and the Balkan. All right. Just don't. Donald Todd. Welcome to the show. We need to finish the Paul Meadow clip. All right. The only reason I'm not in the room, guys is I'm trying to take notes. Follow along. It's a lot easier with multiple screens. So apologies for not being in there at the moment. You're all good. You. All right. All right. So. Here we are. I'll be back. I'll be back. I have to put on room. It's on you here. So. Go to the team. When back, we map the current credit score. You in the office today, let's get in this room. Yeah. Oh, that's true. I'm sorry. So it's hard. To present from there. Yeah. You mean. So from here, we are looking at the clip limit threshold. So we want to use whatever the clip limit is. So we're just going to use the default. So we can either adjust the formula here or there's a little check box. You can just deactivate that individual formula. So it's not used and it doesn't fail. So in that case, we're just going to use what the default max is. Man, it should be 20,000. So clip, see our limit max, 20,000. All right. So we have a bunch of other thresholds that we have to pay attention to as we work through a clip analysis with a client. We review this information and put in. Now they did not adjust them. These are what our recommendations are and they did not change it. So we need to go with our recommendations. And they also did not adjust the credit ranges at all. They just added that they wanted to adjust them after the fact because we're looking at both credit cards and lines of coverage. But they want to make sure that they do not have a maximum aggregate limit of more than these values in these ranges. So we're going to adjust all of the credit based on this information. And we're going to be able to tell from the output file. What their current credit limit is. What the suggested increases to. And then we need to look at the multiple lines of credit to make sure that they do not go past these values. So bind right can can bind. Yeah, so if there are 776 or higher credit score and say the individual Justin Todd has a credit card of 20,000 and a line of credit of 6,000. That's above the 25 max. So we would have to lower one of the values. So if the line of credit is that 6,000 that means that we would just look at the credit card and move it to 19,000 from a 20 makes sense. Yes, we're thumbs up. Okay, and this is all based on the monthly spend. So this is another attribute that we have to look at. I almost feel like I shouldn't have suggested it now, but you know, it's all good. We'll get it done. So do you suggest this not suggesting that to clients in the future? No, I think it's important because it helps bring the card back to top of all it. So if if my credit card, if I'm not using my credit card because I have a $5,000 limit. And my credit card company receives attributes from the credit bureau that says that I use way more than my $5,000 limit. So that's probably a good indicator of why I'm not using it because my max limit isn't within my monthly spend. So if we can get information that says that Justin uses closer to $10,000 a month on his credit card, then we need to increase the limit from $5,000 to at least $10,000. In order for me as a consumer to even think about using the card. So that'll make sense. Makes sense. And it's pretty, yeah. So it is something we have the data. We can use it there the way that Pometo citizens is requesting. Us to use it is a little bit different than what we've done in the past, but you know, with a little bit of a wishful thinking. We can figure it out and make it happen. So we're going through the parameters. Once we're set up here, we look at the actual groupings and go through this just a bunch of nested of statements. So this doesn't really matter. These are just credit limit groupings. This part doesn't affect anything. So we'll just close it. The change in credit score is just taking the current minus the original. That's it. No income estimate. So if the income equals zero or if it's empty, then one here they are asking for a minimum. So we need to put that in here as well. So income estimate, let's see if we can see where these values are. So 20,000. Let's see if we even have anyone close. So I don't even see anybody in here, but there probably is somebody at some point. So we should add it. What are the numbers represent? So it's in thousands. Okay. 20, 30, 20, 20, 30,000. So here's six right here that have no DTI, no income estimator. Five. No data birth for a couple of them. So we're not receiving any data. So some of these will fall out anyways, but there's a couple of zeroes and then errors. So these guys are going to fall out. But what we would do is we would look at the information. Right all this. You hit the top one there, buddy. Not so. So once I if the income is equal to zero or if it's empty or if the income estimator is less than. 20. Yeah, close the per in there. So. Oh. This one, I guess, because just so less than 20 year empty, but that's what we want to do. We want to add that section. We want to disqualify them. Um, for a FICO less than 650, they have a minimum FICO score of 650. So we're okay there. Make sure a minimum FICO is 650. Yep. Flip threshold 649. DTI is 50 on their spreadsheet. It has 50. It's on my other screen, but I'm validating these values is what I'm doing. Making sure that our parameters are all assigned correctly. Um, the blocks are re-assues less fine. So age has to be greater than 21 and, um, maximum 100, you know, not trying to offend anybody, but we're not trying to give a credit line increase to someone that's 100 or one years old. 99 years old with a different story. Yeah, 99. They have at least two years to rack up the balance there. So we're good. Um, so here, we need to remove this. They wanted three years. We wanted to have a card for at least three. We don't care about that. We want three 65. So they have to have at least the card for one year. And the credit limit. This is just the naming convention. It's not what it actually is. The credit limit max here is 20,000. So that's accurate. If I go drop 50 points is what they're asking for. Nothing greater than 50 points. Um, we don't want anything past do. That's our own logic. We don't want bank rubbed. Well, they added these features. I gotta go find that email now because I don't have it open anymore. And you can do drop that on the fake of drug credit and 50, please. So if we're giving it a one, we're filtering them out. Yes, so if they have a one, you will see that down here. So bankruptcies 24 months open trade lines, less than three, month and a half multiple trade lines. So we're going to get you ready. Okay. Okay. I'm having issues finding that email again. Are you able to find it in sentimentally? Top of my inbox. What do you exactly do you need from it? Well, there was in the email itself. There were a couple credit attributes that I said we would use. Oh, here it is. So in addition to customized parameters, we'll review peak monthly spending habits to ensure proposal and efficient confirm that no member has an aggregate limit exceeding 25. Well, they changed it based on color and there's also a few other options. So number of trades 60 days past to. 24 months zero, right? We got that one number of trades 90 or more days past to we've done the link with the link. So we haven't gotten to. This stuff. Number of bankruptcies ever. So we're public bankruptcies 24. So these are like different. I did explain to him that we can't change some of the parameters. He said, what do you say? Thanks. I have a curious. I've got the attributes. Okay. All right. So we'll go back and check those in a second. But we may have to add more here. Because these aren't. These aren't attributes that we're getting. Oh, the ones that he was requesting for this. Yeah, number of trades 90 or more days past to and 24 months. He's saying ever, but that's the trade that we're receiving here. 60 more days past to. I would say for some of these. I mean, we just have to go off of what we got. Yeah. I mean, we told him that we told him that these attributes come from to you. Like these are field names, not like just editable. So. But we don't have anything for any number of trades 90 or more days past to. It would be on one year. There we are. Now, dear more. Okay, so we can do that one in 24 months. Okay. Just into these formulas, they the same as what you use the last time. And need to be adjusted possibly the following time for. Or they go back to like us. And deep or they default to something that's that set up. No, so a lot of these like we found we find to them that these are the types of bars that we we want. These are included in our standard process because we find it to be the best set of users. Or cards that actually use them. So these are the parameters that we set outside of it. I mean, the ones that we allow them to dictate are different lines. Now they don't have to do stuff like this, but you know, we can do it on on our end. We also look at like past do in any line of credit. So like it may not show past do for this particular line of credit. But we're looking if any other lines of credit are past do currently. So maybe this credit card that we're reviewing is not past do, but the member may have a different card or different trade line that is currently past do. So, you know, at that point, it's only a matter of time until this credit card becomes past do so, you know, there's a chance that we don't want to increase their credit line if they're currently past do with with another card or another trade line. So there's just stuff like that that we look at. Reposition trades none and then we come down to the disqualified line. So we want to add the bankrupt seas. They did not ask about the open trade lines and the oldest trade opened one month. And months since oldest trade is less than 24 months. Yeah, then I asked for that. Just didn't. I want to register. Maybe you didn't answer this already, but is there a standard configuration? Um, is there a standard configuration? Yeah, so basically the the standard is only the handful of things that they can adjust. So everything else is considered standard. So these are the parameters that they can adjust and then the buckets for the increases is what they can adjust. I mean, these are just our standard set of parameters. But they're asking for things that are slightly different. So there's fields like the reposition. Excuse me, oldest trade line open trades and bankrupt seas and past do. These are all new that we found work really well to find the right borrowers. That's why they were commented out in the code, but we're adding the bankrupt seas and we're adding the reposition information. Because the client wanted those included. Is there a UI for the client to like, so like these are they done, you know, an collaboration with us. There's not a UI. They're done with us. Or we send them the PDF and then they fill out the information on the PDF because they left this section blank. And we're taking that they wanted our suggested parameters and the same thing with the credit line increases. And this is the only thing that they're changing is they want the current credit limit range based on aggregate limit. So it's the only thing that they had updated in the file. So we're just following that. Okay, so those are made of like a configuration document. Yep. That's how they interact with it. Or they call us right or take it to adjusted. Yeah, I mean, we have a couple like preliminary calls with them and they can do it over the phone, but we try to get an actual document because when stuff's done over the phone, then they'll say we didn't want this update. And it's like, yeah, you did. So that's why we have them fill out the document. Yeah, and keep in mind too. This is like, these are one time. Projects, right, so this engagement is we're just running this stuff once. And then we give them the results and if they want to contract us again in the future, they will, which would come with more. You know, another set of potential changes to parameters. What is the the average life cycle of this engagement like from when they. Say we're going to do this till we finally deliver. Well, outside of contracting. It's like two three days. Yeah, and outside of the contract, yeah, contracting a sign like the actual mechanics of it like we get the file, we get the thing we adjust to we and then we return it around. What's the tournament? It's about two three days. Two three days. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it could be inside of that to if. We're just running through it. Obviously, this is taking us a lot longer as we're. You know, trying to capture everything for videos and processes and things like that, but typically we would probably go much quicker through this stuff. And this is a one person kind of like the right the person who initiates the process finish it all the way to the end. Yeah, yeah, really the only. Um, externality would be waiting on transient. There's no handover to any other. Process or person. No, no, just we send off data to trans union. And when we get all that information back, we can pick right back up and keep moving to finish line. Sounds good. Thanks. And then hold on, we discuss this with the client. Or do we do it at the redest class at all. So in this case, I did. Right, this. Basically this engagement came from. Um, doing a MDPA consultation. Okay. So you take that following your perspective. Yeah, so we did a full like loan analysis and then recommended that they do a clip. And then that's why we're here. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. We have five. We've got to double once a year. I wanted to be. That. You know, because I'm. Contrary to. But it's just wanted to come back. Thank you. Please. Please. Just work. Yeah. Okay. So I have an email where they added. Um. A few new pieces. So they want the bankruptcies in the past 24 months. Um. And reposition trades non-existent. And then they're also looking at the number of chargeoff trades in the past 24 months. They say ever, but we don't have that field. And they say number of trade lines that are more than 60 days past two. And then they also asked for traded lines that are more than 90 days past two. But I'm only adding the 60 days because if um, alone is 90 days past two, then at one point it would have been 60 days past two. So I don't that's three done that. So said to you. Well, here's an example. Hello, now it's 90 days past two. I'm kidding. Well, you find it. You'll be fine. No, but another one. I think it would be very strange if. If it somehow got the 90 days past two with skipping 60 days past two. Exactly. So that's just what I'm saying. Um. Okay. So there we did. We added them as parameters. It's not part of the standard clip process. But I mean, there's we get an absolute boat load of parameters from Trans Union. And you can fine tune it really. How are you see fit? Uh, but I mean, for example, we get four hundred and nineteen fields from Trans Union. So you can just see how they're just forever going. Um, we have that metadata like a dictionary or anything anywhere. Yeah, I want to share a drive. Okay. But there's a lot of really good information. There's also a bunch of information that doesn't make any sense or nothing that we would use for credit cards. Um, but I know that there's other stuff out here that's that's pretty relevant. And there would be, you know, good to possibly enhance the data set at some point. But that's why we're these programs are so successful because we've spent time going through. We've spent time going through the attributes and of cherry pick the ones that are most relevant to see the best results because we've run hundreds of these analysis in the past. Okay. So now after we, um, add these parts, then we ask if they've met the parameters. If they've met the parameters, then they get a one. If they did not meet all the parameters, then they get a zero. And then after that, we are determining the monthly income and the monthly minimum payments. And then we're applying. Um, the proposed new limits, we're adjusting those. So let's do this. Pull this over here. So for the new limits, we want to make sure they should be our standard, but I'm just going to take a quick peek and make sure. So we have less than a thousand. So. Less than a thousand. Move to 1500. 2000 to three. 3 to five. Or to six. Five to 75. Then 75 goes straight to 10. And then we take a minimum of 2,500 plus the limit. Up to. 2000. 20,000. Okay. So that's what we're doing. So basically, I'm just verifying that the formulas for the Kerala and increased program are matching these kind of buckets and these tier. And these tiers. Um, they do. I just had to adjust the first one. And then I just had to adjust the last one to max of 20. Um, where we had 25 in there for before. So now we have a maximum 20,000. And the first bucket is a thousand. So everything looks good. Um, this is a whole another way to do it. Um, but we don't need to get into that because we're not doing that. Doesn't keep do me a favor and just container those like five. Formulas, tools. Just so like I know what I'm looking for when I'm coming in here in the future. Thank you, dude. Um, I'm going to leave you a little trace. Um, I think that's, yeah. I think that's how you're taking. Right. Yeah. Oh, is it all? Uh, you're going to use it all too. And a Christian just kind of like all church wizards. But it's cool. More of a pen ball wizard. Well, I'm just going to go. Thanks for spacing out the, uh, Formulas, just appreciate that. Yeah, I'm, I'm getting excited. Just looking at it. Yeah. I know I don't know my spend as much time in it because I'm going through with you guys. So it's like it's, it's making my eye twitch. Um, so yeah, so that's kind of that. I should be a little bit better. I'll do this. We'll leave that right here because that's in this bucket. And this is another one we're looking at. So here. This is exactly why we add some of the parameters. So here we're looking at loans that have a reposition trade. That's greater than zero in a current credit score. That's above six 49, which is a threshold. And they have 35 records in here. So, you know, there's a chance that these individuals will be dropped for other reasons. But there's 35 extra loans. So the reason why we say we find like the right borrowers is like just because they had a reposition trade at some point in time. Like Paul Metacidicinist doesn't want to have that information. But doesn't mean that they're a bad bar where at today. So that there's a big difference in a 650 credit score that's going up. And a 650 credit score that's coming down. Okay. And you know, Chris can go into that later point. If you guys are truly interested in understanding that. But just because they were, you know, a bad bar were at some point in time. Doesn't mean that it's today. So we would take a deeper look at these 35 loans and see if, you know, I mean, because some of them are in the 700's. Like that's crazy. If you're not going to give someone in the 700's and increase. And unless they're like maxing out the card. So there's just different attributes that we look at. And that's why that's how we find the correct borrowers. All right. Um, so where were we? We were here. We adjusted the parameters 20,000 everything looks good. I want to look at these other pieces. So what we're doing here is we're assigning the debt to income after the proposed new limit. So that's why we were looking at the current monthly income. And we're determining what their monthly payments are. So one of the things that we do most credit cards and your credit card included if you have one, there's a minimum payment threshold. And that's how you determine the minimum balance that you owe. So this is 3% is the minimum payment. Sometimes it's 2%. So that's where the value could possibly change here. So we want to customize it to use to work with their credit cards. If their credit cards is times in the current balance by 2% then we would adjust it to 2% but in this case it's 3. So we're going to leave it at that. Once we assign it then we're basically just saying if they qualify for the new increase and we're assigning a Boolean, we're going to have one or zero to let you know. And then the original proposed new limit values. I don't even know what this is for. Not only remember. Let's get to know. I think we added this because the proposed new limit values. Okay, because I adjusted it so much for the previous run. So this was just the default from the very beginning. I see we're only going to 14 to 50. All right, so yeah, that's that. So that we're not going to work with doesn't matter. So what we're doing is at this point we're deselecting a lot of the fields and we're filtering. So this filter is just saying hey we only want those that qualified so of the 25,000 that joined in only 17,000. 284 qualified now we added a couple of additional fields. So I'm assuming that number will go down a little bit from 17,000. So let's see because we added a couple of extra parameters. No, it went up and then increased. I can't be right. Yeah, I can't be right. And unless they're dollar amounts are higher than what we're in there originally. And it allowed us to expand. So that's true. It did. So that's part of it. All right, we will check and make sure everything still looks good. But basically there's 18 now. So what we want to do is we want to look at the proposed numbers. These are the proposed new limits. So the 1500 means that they had a thousand dollar credit limit or less. So these all have a hundred dollar credit limit. And I'll put them up to a thousand. But we want to make sure that there aren't any. We don't really have any of the fields here. So we need to go further back. Even here the fields aren't coming through. So I need to do quick analysis. Just make sure all this is looking good. Just in the habit of question. Are these credit line increases. Like up in or at the or customers actually just pass them across the board. So this is like this is like if you're just chilling out your house and your credit card company just sends you a letter and says, hey, by the way, you've been a good bar were. You have a five thousand dollar limit. We're going to increase you to 7500. So you're not doing anything yourself as the consumer. So you're not going to have to go to the credit union. These these are automatic. Yeah, so they're they're looked at under the principle purpose of account review. So periodically credit unions and banks and financial institutions are allowed to. Pull your credit just to see you know where you stand and they do this for that for that reason. Now my question is. Does do we do a center right we call it credit line increase. Do we do automatic credit line decreases. We do not. No, would we ever recommend that. Chris and I would not recommend that. It's not it's not good practice. It's not but I used to work for. We actually just like we did. Great of my new cases. We would also give big increases. Yeah, so I mean, we we can go into that on on a separate, you know, call it it's. I agree with Chris is not something that that we would do as best practice. We would find a hundred ways for you to better utilize that information. Then to actually give so in a decrease. But yes, I mean, could we do that? Yes, we could. Some of our clients. Yeah, so one of our clients asked for that. They want to do a management on the increases. Not looking for an increase. They're looking to manage their credit lines. So it was good. Big issue. That was it was it was Paul Meadow that I said a question to. Well, yeah, we we told them that we went do it. We'll give them the information so they can do it as they know that all of the information at their hands, but we're not going to recommend users to do that. So here this one of the parameters. I'm just taking a quick peek and making sure that none of the there's no values that are greater than zero number of charge off trays in the past 24 months. That was one of the. One of the fields. I want to make sure that there's no collection inquiries at all. That was one of the ones. So we'll go to a high number of descending should also be zero. Number of public bankruptcies again should also be zero. So just take in a quick peek at the new parameters that we added. Number of reposition trays also zero. So number of trade line bankruptcy. So here they did have a couple trade line bankruptcies. Some of these just not in the past 24 months. So like this one, for example, had a bankruptcy at some point in time. Let's see, so they've had the card for a couple of years. They have a $8,000 balance proposed to 3,000. They have a 720, 3 and a 25 DTI. So yeah, that's not anything too crazy. I'm still going to pass that alone. Even after the increase, they're only at 25%. So here's the other ones. We want to make sure that none of the trade lines are more past two. Nothing above zero makes sense. And I think there's anything else about to take another quick peek. Repositions, collections, trades. So we did all those. And here's a go. So months since the most credit card delinquency, and months since the most recent delinquency period. So a couple of these guys in the past two to three years had the link one. See, I was just thinking too Justin, the 90 day. Passed two in the past 24 months. It is possible that a 60 day pass do fell off. And we're in like the 24th month. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah. So just make sure that there aren't any in there. Okay. Go ahead and see there's not. But I can imagine that scenario. Okay. Yeah. See what you're saying. But yeah. So we don't have any better 90 days either. So I'm not going to go back and adjust the logic because we just looked and we're good to go. So we'll move past that. But we will include some of these fields. All right. So we're good. We're going to add. It should be everything. Um. To that and come over here. Of course. This thing is so finicky. Um. So the outputs are being logged. Home at a citizens. It's going out there. So it looks good. Come over here. We'll add some fields. We don't normally give them these types of fields. But we're going to do something else. So I want them. I need the credit range. Yeah. So the comparing of a different. Credit line types. We're doing that outside of all of this. Correct. Yep. Okay. Um. Okay. These are at the very end. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So these are going back out. Um. The important part is we're looking for zeros and these. So we're looking at records. Make sure there's no duplicates. So we want to be zero. Want to be zero. That makes sense. Um. So what we're doing is we're pulling in all the old information. So this is the current analysis that we just ran for Pometo citizens. Um, and a prior workflow. We had the values come through. Here for qualified and all of these were null. Now that we've finished the analysis. We have ones and zeros to let you know that we did not approve Cureline increases for these two, but for these two we did. That's when we did not all of these we did. And so on so on. So we have the information out in the database. And we can write it from that point and then we're also sending the information. So we're saying, hey, about 74% of the cards that we analyze here are receiving. Excuse me. Cureline increases. Or that were recommending them to receive Cureline increase. So come over here. We're just going to save it real quick because we made some changes. And then we need to open the buckets. So we can actually write. So this is a bucket that writes. This is a bucket that writes. And all sound. Any questions? All right. So everything wrote. We're good to go. That's cool. Be a lot cooler if you did. What are you trying to do now? Step by the two. These are lines of credit. Yep. So the client in this particular case as s. That we look at anybody that might be a single member that has both a credit card and a line of credit. And a term in which one we would recommend increasing over the other. They do not want to increase both. That's cool. That's cool. We don't take all the fields all the way across. What fields are you missing? The ones that we built in you can identify half of. So there's multiple credit cards. And then they probably have lines of coverage as well. What would this is the fun part? So there's a count number. Help number to a count number. 1500. We have the low and ideas. So the original balance is good. So this match count numbers. Let's match.
